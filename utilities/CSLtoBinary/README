This command line utility takes a file of space separated 8 bit numbers (written as numbers 0 -255)

and out puts the data into binary files.

The command takes two command line args

1. The file with the data in it (generally a .txt file)

2. The number of  bytes to put in each file



NOTE: if the second parameter is omitted all the bytes will be put into one file.


Files are output into the ./out directory, numbered starting from 0, as .bin files

The program can be compilled by calling make in the project dir, and the program is output to the bin folder



Known bug:
Sometimes an extra .bin file is generated with just a 0 in it
